## **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting electric production data using various time series models. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end time series analysis, model development, evaluation, and visualization using modern forecasting techniques.

## **Project Description**
This project implements various time series forecasting models to predict electric production values over a specific period. It includes:  
1. Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.  
2. Visualization of trends, seasonality, and cyclic behavior.  
3. Implementation of forecasting models: 
  - **ARIMA**: A classical model for stationary time series.
  - **SARIMA**: An enhanced version of ARIMA for handling seasonal components.
  - **STS Simple exponential smoothing**: Captures exponential trends and seasonality.
  - **Prophet (by Meta)**: Robust for time series with irregularities or holidays.
  - **Holt-Winterâ€™s Exponential Smoothing (HWES)**: A variation of ETS that explicitly models seasonality and trends.
  - **Amazon/Chronos-T5-Tiny**: A transformer-based model for time series forecasting.
4. Evaluation of model performance using standard metrics.
